# leJOS RobotPilot
A robot pilot (Similar to DifferentialPilot) for EV3 leJOS. Has several functions, which are missing in the DifferentialPilot.

The RobotPilot is a pilot for anyone, who wants to do more stuff with their leJOS EV3 robot without writing their own differential pilot.
The main advantage against the DifferentialPilot is the ability to control a single motor through the pilot.

The RobotPilot is completely open-source and can be modified and used by everyone
