# leJOS RobotPilot
A robot pilot (Similar to DifferentialPilot) for EV3 leJOS. Has several functions, which are missing in the DifferentialPilot.

The RobotPilot is a pilot for anyone, who wants to do more stuff with their leJOS EV3 robot without writing their own differential pilot.
The main advantage against the DifferentialPilot is the <b>ability to control a single motor</b> through the pilot.

The RobotPilot is <b>completely open-source</b> and can be modified and used by anyone.
